Please read the entire agreement and definitions below.

Commercial vs. Open Source License
Source Software may be made available under this Commercial License and under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). This Commercial License requires the payment of a fee for each Designated User (i.e. developer). If you choose not to pay a fee and use the GPLv3 license, you are required to release the source code of any program that you distribute with the Software. If you choose to pay for a Commercial License, you are not required to disclose your source code. No closed source application can include or use LTE Consulting Ext JS or LTE Consulting GXT unless commercially licensed, whether or not you modify these libraries.

GPL & Trial Development
You cannot commence development of an application under GPLv3 license and later convert to a commercial license. You cannot develop during a trial period and continue development beyond the trial period (30 days). You must download the appropriate version of the Software (GPL or Commercial) for the license that you are using. If you fail to comply with licensing requirements you may be subject to action for intellectual property rights infringement.

Prohibited Uses
Under this Commercial License, you are not allowed to create applications that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder or any application that is intended for use by software, application, or website developers or designers. If you are concerned about this prohibition, you can discuss getting an OEM license by emailing us at contact@lteconsulting.fr.

Designated Users
Under this Commercial License, each Designated User (a developer or anybody using the Software to design UI) must be licensed. You can move the license to another Designated User every 6 months.

Consultants and Software Integrators
Consultants and SI’s that develop applications must insure that the third parties for which they develop are licensed for the Software. In some cases, you can transfer your license to the third party, and in other cases third parties will need to have their own Commercial License. Consultants can’t use the same license to build application for multiple customers, if the customers are to own the application.

Please read the entire LTE Consulting Software License Agreement. Commercial License is governed by the terms of this agreement and not by the terms of this Summary of Important License Use Restrictions.
